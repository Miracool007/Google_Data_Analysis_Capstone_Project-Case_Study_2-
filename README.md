## Project Overview
Bellabeat, a high-tech company that makes health-focused goods for women, 
feels that evaluating fitness data from smart devices may be able to open up new business prospects for them. 
I've been asked to concentrate on one of Bellabeat's products and analyze data from smart devices to learn more about how customers use them,
thisÂ information will assist the company's marketing approach.
#### Dataset Used
The data source used for our case study is FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is stored in Kaggle and was made available through Mobius.
After collecting enough data and making sure the data was free from bias, I was asked three questions which will aid my analysis, they are;
1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could this trends apply to Bellabeat's customers?
3. How could this trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
### Project Findings
After thorough analysis and finding trends and relationships within the dataset, I came up with the following findings;
Below we can see that users are fairly distributed by their activities, considering the daily amount of steps taken.
We can determine that based on users' activities, all kind of users wear smart-devices.

According to health practitioners, the recommended steps an individual should take daily for a healthier living is 7500 steps, while a minimum of 480 minutes
(8 hours) of sleep is also recommended. Below in the graph, we can determine that;
1. Users walked the recommended amount of steps of 7500 except for Sundays
2. Users don't sleep the recommended amount of sleep (8 hours/480 minutes)

Digging deeper into our analysis we wanted to know when exactly are users more active in a day. From the chart below, we can see that users are more active between 8am and 7pm. 
Walking more steps in the afternoons from 12pm to 2pm and evenings from 5pm and 7pm.

Now that we have seen some trends in steps taken and amount of sleep, we want to see how often do the users in our sample use their device. 
That way we can plan our marketing strategy and see what features would benefit the users of smart devices.

Analyzing our results we can see that
1. 50% of the users of our sample use their device frequently - between 21 to 31 days.
2. 12% use their device 11 to 20 days.
3. 38% of our sample use really rarely their device.
### Conclusion & Recommendations
After my analysis, I have found different trends that will help the online campaign and improve Bellabeat app. I therefore proffer the following recommendations;
1. Daily notification of steps and post on app - We classified users into 4 categories and saw that the average of users walk more than 7,500 steps daily besides Sundays.
   We can encourage customers to reach at least the daily recommended steps, 8,000, by sending them alarms if they haven't reached the steps and creating also posts on the app explaining the benefits of reaching that goal.
2. Sleep time notification and Technique - Based on our result we can users sleep less than 8 hours a day. They could setup a desired to go to sleep and receive notifications
   minutes before the set time, reminding them to go sleep. Also offer helpfull resources to help customers sleep such as breathing advises, relaxing music, and sleep techniques.
3. Reward system - most people aren't moved by notifications, so we could setup a kind of game in our app for limited period of time. Game would consist in reaching different levels based on amount of steps walked every day.
   You need to maintain an activity level for a period of time (maybe a month) to pass to the next level.
   For each level you would win certain amount of stars that would be redeemable for a discount on other Bellabeat products.
4. Extra smart-device features - extra features such as long-lasting batteries, water resistance, fashionable and elegant should also be considered during the production
   of the next set of smart-devices.
